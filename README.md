# ðŸ§  Predicting the Hypotenuse with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the hypotenuse (c) of a right-angled triangle using sides a and b, based on Pythagoras' Theorem. It's part of the **Software III - MRAC01** course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

### 1 - Approximate the mathematical formula
\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

using shallow machine learning.


### 2 - Compare Linear Regression with MLP Regressor

Pythagoras' Theorem is nonlinear due to the square root function.

The comparison showed that:

Linear Regression:
- Linear Regression can only model straight-line relationships between input and output.
- As a result, it tries to approximate the curved function with a flat plane, leading to higher error.

MLP Regressor:
- The MLP Regressor (Multi-Layer Perceptron) is a type of neural network that can model complex, nonlinear relationships.
- It learns the curvature of the âˆš(aÂ² + bÂ²) function more effectively.
- This results in very low MSE and perfect RÂ², meaning it captured the relationship almost perfectly.

## Installation

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Workflow

### 1. Generate Dataset

```bash
python src/generate_dataset.py
```

Creates `data/triangle_dataset.csv` with random side lengths and computed hypotenuse.

---

### 2. Train Model

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

Trains a Linear Regression model and saves it to `models/linear_regression_model.pkl`.

---

### 3. Evaluate Model

```bash
python src/evaluate_model.py
```

Prints metrics and saves the prediction plot to `results/pred_vs_true.png`.

---
